# Why do we use OOP?
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

# Library Management System
This is a library management system. Admin will have all the access. There will be two different types of accounts like Student Account and Teacher Account. Students can register as General or Premium. Teacher account is always Premium. Admin can Categorize and Manage Books. I will use OOP to design these features.
